# COEN 12 Lab
- Source code for COEN 12: Abstract Data Types and Structures Lab, taken in Winter 2021, taught by Dr. Xiang Li

  - Lab 1:
    - Application to read words from a text file and return total number of words.

  - Lab 2: 
    - Implementation of a set abstract data type for strings.

  - Lab 3: 
    - Implementation of a set abstract data type, for strings and for generic pointer types.

  - Lab 4: 
    - Implementation of a dequeue, and a set with hashing with chaining.

  - Lab 5: 
    - Implementation of a priority queue ADT for Huffman tree coding.

  - Lab 6: 
    - Implementation of the quick sort algorithm for a set ADT.

  - Term Project: 
    - Implementation of a college data set, searching for a student based on age and ID.
    

## Expected Learning Outcomes: Students will ...

1. Discuss the relationships between an abstract data type and a data structure.

2. Separate an abstract data type into an interface and an implementation.

3. Compare and contrast simple container data types (lists, sets, maps, priority queues).

4. Compare and contrast classic data structures (arrays, hash tables, linked-lists, trees, graphs).

5. Implement the classic data structures in a low-level language such as C.

6. Know the average-case and worst-case running times for common operations (insertion,
deletion, retrieval, minimum, maximum) on the classic data structures.

7. Compare and contrast classic searching and sorting algorithms.
